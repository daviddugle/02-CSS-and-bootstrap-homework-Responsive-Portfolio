                        <p>Thank you for visiting my website, I am glad you stopped by. I am just beginning my coding
                            journey but am eager to build upon my life experience to be a better developer. What's my
                            background? I am glad you asked...I am an ARMY National Guard veteran and I worked for an
                            armored car company for
                            20
                            years. </p>
                        <p>I loved working for the armored car company and early on I was recognized as being
                            tech-savvy. I was one of the first dedicated ATM Messengers for the branch that I worked
                            for.
                            Being affiliated with ATMs allowed me to grow rapidly within the company and eventually
                            becoming
                            a District Manager. They offered me a lot of opportunities and moved me around many areas;
                            Indiana, Georgia, Multiple areas of Florida and finally here in North Carolina. </p>
                        <p> I am really excited for this new adventure and already know that it was a great decision. I
                            am thankful for all opportunities I have been given and earned in life and want to make the
                            most of this one.</p>
